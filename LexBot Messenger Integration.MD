Creating a Chat Bot with Amazon Lexbot Services:

First, I utilized Amazon Lexbot services to design and build my chat bot. This involved defining intents (the goals of user inputs), establishing utterances (sample phrases users might say), and configuring responses for different scenarios.
Setting Up a Facebook Page:

Next, I went to Facebook and created a dedicated page for my chat bot. This page serves as the platform where users will interact with my bot, asking questions or making requests.
Accessing the Facebook Developer Portal:

Then, I visited the Facebook Developer Portal. This is where I found the tools and resources needed to connect external applications, like my chat bot, with Facebook services.
Creating a New App:

Within the Developer Portal, I started by setting up a new application. I thought of this app as the intermediary that would link my Amazon Lex bot with Facebook Messenger.
Obtaining an Access Token:

I generated an access token. This is a special key that establishes a secure connection between my app and Facebook's Messenger platform. It acts as a unique identifier, allowing my app to communicate effectively with Messenger.
Testing the Integration:

To ensure everything is working smoothly, I sent a test message from Facebook Messenger. I received a response from my Amazon Lex bot, confirming that the integration is functioning correctly.
