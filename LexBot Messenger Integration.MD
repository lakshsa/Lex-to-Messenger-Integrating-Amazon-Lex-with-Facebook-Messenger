Creating a Chat Bot with Amazon Lexbot Services:

1. First, I utilized Amazon Lexbot services to design and build my chat bot. This involved defining intents , establishing utterances , and configuring responses for different scenarios.

2. Setting Up a Facebook Page:
Next, I went to Facebook and created a dedicated page for my chat bot. This page serves as the platform where users will interact with my bot, asking questions or making requests.

3. Accessing the Facebook Developer Portal:
Then, I visited the Facebook Developer Portal. This is where I found the tools and resources needed to connect external applications, like my chat bot, with 

4. Facebook services.
Creating a New App:
Within the Developer Portal, I started by setting up a new application. I thought of this app as the intermediary that would link my Amazon Lex bot with Facebook Messenger.

5. Obtaining an Access Token:
I generated an access token. This is a special key that establishes a secure connection between my app and Facebook's Messenger platform. It acts as a unique identifier, allowing my app to communicate effectively with Messenger.

6. Testing the Integration:
To ensure everything is working smoothly, I sent a test message from Facebook Messenger. I received a response from my Amazon Lex bot, confirming that the integration is functioning correctly.

7. Bot Functionality:
This chat bot is designed to facilitate the ordering process for flower bouquets. It responds to user queries and prompts related to flower orders, guiding them through the selection and checkout process.

To initiate a conversation with the bot, users can simply start by saying something like, "I'd like to buy a flower." The bot will then lead them through a series of prompts to choose the type of bouquet, specify delivery details, and complete the order.

Behind the scenes, Amazon Lex's natural language processing capabilities enable the bot to understand and interpret user input. It uses predefined intents and slots to extract relevant information, ensuring a smooth and efficient ordering experience.
